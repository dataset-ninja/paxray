**PAXRAY: A Projected dataset for the segmentation of Anatomical structures in X-RAY data** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 852 images with 161742 labeled objects belonging to 165 different classes including *lung_overall*, *lung_left_lobeupper*, *lung_left_lobelower*, and other: *lung_right_lobeupper*, *lung_right_lobemiddle*, *lung_right_lobelower*, *mediastinum_overall*, *mediastinum_lower*, *mediastinum_upper*, *mediastinum_anterior*, *mediastinum_middle*, *mediastinum_posterior*, *heart*, *airways*, *esophagus*, *aorta*, *aorta_arch*, *bones*, *spine*, *t1*, *t2*, *t3*, *t4*, *t5*, *t6*, *t7*, *t8*, *t9*, and 137 more.

Images in the PAXRAY dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (598 images), *test* (180 images), and *val* (74 images). Additionally, every image has following tags: ***im_id*** and ***view*** (frontal or lateral). The dataset was released in 2022 by the GE joint research group.
