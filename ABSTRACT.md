The authors of the dataset present a novel pipeline for generating annotations to assist the CXR (chest X-ray) domain by extracting information from more easily annotatable CTs (computed tomography scans). They provide a densely labeled fine-grained dataset for anatomy segmentation, encompassing both frontal and lateral views. The methodology leverages the consistency of anatomy across imaging domains, utilizing established models in the CT domain to generate annotations automatically. These annotations and corresponding images are then projected to 2D, mimicking the X-ray domain.

To exploit anatomical structures, the authors used a sophisticated automatic system for collecting and integrating human body structures from computed tomography data first fine-grained anatomy dataset: **PAXRAY: A Projected dataset for the segmentation of Anatomical structures in X-RAY data**. Their evaluation showed that methods using anatomical information significantly improved the visual support of radiologists' conclusions. Based on high-quality predictions in CT space, the authors displayed 92 individual anatomical marks structures which, including superclasses, lead to a total of 166 labels in both _side_ and _front_ view. All annotations in both lateral and frontal view are overlapping:
